# Real-Time-Car-Audio-Emitter
[Spring 2023] [CSC 484D] [Course Project] - UVic Synthesizer Programming

## Proposal
Virtual cars in racing video games produce engine sounds that mimic their real life counter parts, and modern electric cars often produce artificial sounds. As the speed (RPM) of the engine varies, the frequencies and amplitude of the engine change. These changes in sound provide information to the driver of the state of their vehicle, pedestrians concerned about their safety may listen for these sounds. Youtuber AngeTheGreat created a virtual engine simulator which supports any kind of engine configuration, this tool produces realistic sounding engine audio. Unfortunately, this project requires a significant amount of processing resources to run at real time, and requires an understanding of ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) to configure. The goal of this project is to create a synthesizer to produce realistic car audio sounds at real time with simplified parameters. The sound produced by the synthesizer will depend on engine RPM. As the project develops the goal is for the synthesizer to support customization and engine presets which produce unique waveforms based on existing internal combustion engines.
 
Some parameters may include:
Number of cylinders
Cylinder size
Engine layout: Inline vs Boxster vs V* (V4, V6, V8, etc) vs Rotary
Engine stroke: 2-Stroke vs 4-Stroke

Hopefully this is within the ballpark of acceptable projects, feedback would be much appreciated.
